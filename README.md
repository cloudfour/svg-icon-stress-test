## Getting started

1. Install dependencies: `npm ci`
1. Build assets and start server: `npm start`
1. Navigate to one of the URLs output in Terminal.

If you encounter errors or issues, make sure your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version satisfies this project's `.nvmrc` file. If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, you can run `nvm use` to get in sync.

## Customizing icons

If you'd like to run the stress test with a different set of icons, you can do so by adding SVG files to the `icons` directory.
